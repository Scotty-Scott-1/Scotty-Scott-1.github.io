In the scenario of active participation, where users are swiping through profiles in search of potential matches, the significance of real-time notifications cannot be overstated. A match, symbolizing mutual interest and compatibility, serves as a pivotal moment in the user's journey. Therefore, upon a successful match, users are promptly notified, underscoring the immediacy and responsiveness of the platform.

For users who find themselves temporarily disconnected from the platform, perhaps due to obligations or other engagements, the assurance of not missing out on potential matches remains paramount. In such instances, the system diligently logs any matches that occur during the user's absence, poised to deliver notifications upon their subsequent log-in. This asynchronous approach ensures that no opportunity for connection goes unnoticed, maintaining user satisfaction and engagement.

This intricate balance between real-time interaction and delayed notification epitomizes the nuanced approach adopted by contemporary dating platforms. It reflects a commitment to user-centric design, wherein every effort is made to facilitate meaningful connections while respecting the diverse lifestyles and preferences of users.
